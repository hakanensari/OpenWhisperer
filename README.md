# Open Whisperer

Full interactive Voice mode for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) on Apple Silicon. Talk to your AI, hear it talk back — all running locally on your Mac. Three voice input modes, Auto-Focus & easy setup. Open Source.

Build from source or DMG, do not pay the 99/year so you would have to allow it to run.

The command to bypass Gatekeeper for the DMG:
xattr -cr /Applications/Open\ Whisperer.app

If you want to do it on the DMG itself before opening:
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/OpenWhisperer-1.4.0.dmg


## What It Does

You use Claude Code or Codex CLI normally. After every response, the AI's answer is automatically spoken aloud through your Mac's speakers using a local TTS model. Three voice input modes: **Press-to-Talk** (press hotkey to start/stop), **Hold-to-Talk** (hold hotkey to record, release to transcribe), or **Hands-Free** (say "initiate" to start recording, 3s silence auto-transcribes, say "hold on" to interrupt TTS).

Everything runs on your Mac — no cloud APIs, no data leaves your machine.

## What's New in 1.4.0

- **Streaming text-to-speech** — speech starts after the first sentence is synthesized instead of waiting for the whole response, so the AI starts talking back noticeably sooner. Playback is gapless, and "hold on" barge-in stops it near-instantly.
- **Fully native** — speech-to-text (WhisperKit) and text-to-speech (FluidAudio Kokoro) now run in-process on the Apple Neural Engine. No Python, no separate server process to manage, and a faster cold start.
- **Codex TTS respects your volume** — the Codex CLI hook now honors the in-app volume setting instead of a fixed level.
- **Stability & security hardening** — fixed a transcription-overlay teardown crash, mode-switch edge cases that could mis-route dictated text, dictation landing in the wrong app when a menubar menu (ours or another utility's) was open, a faster/cleaner app quit, clearer audio-engine error messages, and tighter permissions on config files.

## Install

[**Download OpenWhisperer-1.4.0.dmg**](https://github.com/PerIPan/OpenWhisperer/releases/download/v1.4.0/OpenWhisperer-1.4.0.dmg) — drag to Applications and launch.

On first launch, the app:
- Downloads the Whisper (speech-to-text) and Kokoro (text-to-speech) CoreML models
- Loads both models on the Apple Neural Engine
- Starts the in-app TTS server automatically (loopback only, port 8000)

The menubar icon gives you:
- Start/Stop/Restart server with configurable port
- **Push-to-Talk** — configurable hotkey (Ctrl, fn, Option, Cmd) to record
- **Language selector** — set STT language to avoid hallucinations (17 languages)
- **Voice picker** — choose from 11 Kokoro voices across 8 languages (no server restart needed)
- **Voice detail** — how verbose the spoken summary is: Terse, Normal (default), or Rich
- **TTS Volume** — Low, Medium (default), or High output volume
- **Start on startup** — optional login item to launch automatically when you log in
- **Automation** — Auto-Focus and Auto-Submit (requires Accessibility permission)
- **Platform selector** — switch between Claude Code and Codex CLI (auto-configures hooks)
- **Auto-Apply** — one-click setup for the hooks (adapts to selected platform)
- **Accessibility prompt** — asks for permission on first launch with live granted/not-granted status
- **Diagnostic checklist** — shows hook and TTS status at a glance
- **Transcription overlay** — floating window showing live waveform and recent transcriptions
- **Events log** — diagnostic log for troubleshooting paste and transcription issues
- TTS server log (the in-app native TTS server)

After setup, use the menubar buttons for configuration instructions.

## Voice Input Modes

Three modes for speech-to-text, all using your local Whisper model. Transcribed text is typed directly into whatever app you have focused.

### Hold-to-Talk (default)

1. Hold **Ctrl** — recording starts immediately
2. Speak your message
3. Release **Ctrl** — audio is transcribed and inserted

### Press-to-Talk

1. Press **Ctrl** — recording starts (red indicator)
2. Speak your message
3. Press **Ctrl** again — audio is sent to Whisper for transcription
4. Text is inserted via Accessibility (native apps) or CGEvent Unicode typing (all others) — clipboard is never touched

### Hands-Free

No button press needed. Uses on-device keyword detection (Apple Speech framework).

1. say **"initiate"** — recording starts (cyan → red indicator)
2. speak your message
3. **3 seconds of silence** — audio is auto-transcribed and inserted
4. returns to listening for "initiate" again
5. say **"hold on"** during TTS playback — interrupts audio and starts recording

> **Tip:** "Hold on" barge-in works best with headphones — without them the mic may pick up the TTS audio instead of your voice.

### Requirements

- **Microphone permission** — macOS will prompt on first use
- **Accessibility permission** — required for typing text into other apps. Grant in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility

> **Note:** After rebuilding from source, you must remove and re-add the app in Accessibility settings (macOS caches the code signature).

### Automation

Both features are in the **Automation** section of the menubar and require **Accessibility permission** (macOS will prompt you on first use).

#### Auto-Focus

Enable **Auto-Focus** to automatically bring a specific app to the front when you finish speaking. Pick from 15 apps (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Xcode, Sublime Text, Nova, Fleet, Claude, Terminal, iTerm2, Warp, Alacritty, Ghostty) or select **CUSTOM** to type any app name. Uses native `NSRunningApplication.activate()` — no System Events permission needed.

#### Auto-Submit

Enable **Auto-Submit** to automatically submit after every transcription — no trigger word needed. The transcribed text is typed and Enter is pressed.

**Barge-in:** Any currently playing TTS audio is automatically interrupted when you start recording (press Ctrl) or when Auto-Submit triggers, so you can speak without waiting for the AI to finish talking.

### Fallback: macOS Dictation

If you prefer not to grant Accessibility permission, press **fn fn** to use built-in macOS dictation. Less accurate for technical terms, but works instantly with zero setup.

## How Spoken Replies Work

There's no special tag to add — voice mode works automatically. The app and its hooks coordinate so that only **voice-dictated** turns are spoken; turns you type stay silent:

1. When you dictate, the app records a fingerprint of the text it inserted.
2. The **UserPromptSubmit** hook recognizes that turn as a voice turn and quietly nudges the model to open its reply with a short summary that stands alone.
3. The **Stop** hook takes the first paragraph of the reply, strips markdown (capped at ~600 characters), and speaks it through the local Kokoro TTS model.

- **Screen**: you see the full detailed response
- **Speakers**: you hear the spoken opening summary

### Voice Detail Levels

Choose how verbose that opening summary should be (set in the menubar under **Detail**):

| Level | Spoken summary |
|-------|----------------|
| **Terse** | One short sentence — just the key outcome |
| **Normal** | One plain sentence (default) |
| **Rich** | A sentence or two of summary |

## Configuration

Most settings are configured from the menubar (voice, volume, language, hotkey, detail level) and stored under `~/Library/Application Support/OpenWhisperer`. The hooks and `speak.sh` also honor a few environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Used by | Description |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `TTS_VOICE` | `af_heart` | hooks, `speak.sh` | Kokoro voice name (the menubar voice picker overrides this) |
| `TTS_PLAY_URL` | `http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/play` | hooks | In-app streaming-playback endpoint (loopback only) |
| `TTS_URL` | `http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech` | `speak.sh` | Blocking synthesize-to-WAV endpoint |
| `TTS_VOLUME` | `1` | `speak.sh` | Playback volume (the in-app player uses the menubar volume setting instead) |

> **Tip:** Setting a specific language (e.g. English) instead of auto-detect prevents Whisper from hallucinating text in other languages during silence or background noise.

## Troubleshooting

**No audio after response:**
1. Check the TTS server is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/v1/models`
2. Test TTS directly: `echo "hello" | ./scripts/speak.sh`
3. Check the hook path in `settings.json` is correct and absolute
4. Remember only **dictated** turns are spoken — typed prompts stay silent by design

**Push-to-talk not typing text:**
1. Check Accessibility permission is granted in System Settings
2. If rebuilt from source, remove and re-add the app in Accessibility settings (macOS caches the code signature)
3. Check the Events Log in the menubar for diagnostic details

## Building from Source

> **Tip:** You can ask your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to run these steps for you. Just paste the section below into your AI chat.

### Prerequisites

- Mac with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4), macOS 14 or later
- Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`) — provides `swift`
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) or [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — only needed to run the hooks straight from the source tree (the built `.app` bundles its own copy). Install with one of:
  ```bash
  # Option A: Direct download (no package manager needed)
  curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/jq https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/download/jq-1.7.1/jq-macos-arm64 && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jq

  # Option B: Homebrew (if you have it)
  brew install jq
  ```

There is **no Python, virtualenv, or `pip`/`uv` step** — speech-to-text and text-to-speech are native Swift (WhisperKit + FluidAudio) and run in-process on the Apple Neural Engine.

### Step 1: Build the app

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerIPan/OpenWhisperer.git
cd OpenWhisperer/app
chmod +x build-dmg.sh
./build-dmg.sh
```

This produces `Open Whisperer.app` and `OpenWhisperer-1.4.0.dmg` in `app/.build/`. Launch the app — on first launch it downloads the Whisper and Kokoro models, then starts the in-app TTS server on `localhost:8000` automatically. (For a plain debug build during development, run `swift build` from `app/`.)

### Step 2: Wire up the hooks

The easiest path is the menubar's **Auto-Apply** button, which writes the right hooks for the selected platform (Claude Code or Codex CLI). To do it by hand for Claude Code, add this to `~/.claude/settings.json` (or a project's `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "/absolute/path/to/OpenWhisperer/hooks/tts-hook.sh", "timeout": 60 } ] }
    ],
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "/absolute/path/to/OpenWhisperer/hooks/voice-context.sh", "timeout": 60 } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/OpenWhisperer` with where you cloned the repo. The `UserPromptSubmit` hook detects voice turns; the `Stop` hook speaks the reply. That's all — no `CLAUDE.md` or `[VOICE:]` tag is required.

### Running the TTS server headlessly

For testing or CI you can run just the native TTS server, no GUI:

```bash
cd app
swift run OpenWhisperer --serve-tts   # serves http://localhost:8000 (set TTS_PORT to change)
```
