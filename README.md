# Open Whisperer

Full interactive Voice mode for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) and [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex) on Apple Silicon. Talk to your AI, hear it talk back — all running locally on your Mac. Three voice input modes, Auto-Focus & easy setup. Open Source.

Build from source or DMG, do not pay the 99/year so you would have to allow it to run.

The command to bypass Gatekeeper for the DMG:
xattr -cr /Applications/Open\ Whisperer.app

If you want to do it on the DMG itself before opening:
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/OpenWhisperer-1.4.0.dmg


## What It Does

You use Claude Code or Codex CLI normally. After every response, the AI's answer is automatically spoken aloud through your Mac's speakers using a local TTS model. Three voice input modes: **Press-to-Talk** (press hotkey to start/stop), **Hold-to-Talk** (hold hotkey to record, release to transcribe), or **Hands-Free** (say "initiate" to start recording, 3s silence auto-transcribes, say "hold on" to interrupt TTS).

Everything runs on your Mac — no cloud APIs, no data leaves your machine.

## Install

[**Download OpenWhisperer-1.4.0.dmg**](https://github.com/PerIPan/OpenWhisperer/releases/download/v1.4.0/OpenWhisperer-1.4.0.dmg) — drag to Applications and launch.

On first launch, the app:
- Creates a Python environment with all dependencies
- Downloads MLX Whisper (~1.5GB) and Kokoro TTS (~300MB) models
- Starts the unified server automatically

The menubar icon gives you:
- Start/Stop/Restart server with configurable port
- **Push-to-Talk** — configurable hotkey (Ctrl, fn, Option, Cmd) to record
- **Language selector** — set STT language to avoid hallucinations (17 languages)
- **Voice picker** — choose from 11 Kokoro voices across 8 languages (no server restart needed)
- **Voice detail** — set VOICE tag verbosity: Brief (1 sentence), Natural (1-3), or Detailed (4-6)
- **TTS Volume** — Low, Medium (default), or High output volume
- **Start on startup** — optional login item to launch automatically when you log in
- **Automation** — Auto-Focus and Auto-Submit (requires Accessibility permission)
- **Platform selector** — switch between Claude Code and Codex CLI (auto-configures hooks and voice tags)
- **Auto-Apply** — one-click setup for hooks and voice tags (adapts to selected platform)
- **Accessibility prompt** — asks for permission on first launch with live granted/not-granted status
- **Diagnostic checklist** — shows hook, voice tag, and TTS status at a glance
- **Transcription overlay** — floating window showing live waveform and recent transcriptions
- **Events log** — diagnostic log for troubleshooting paste and transcription issues
- Unified server log (STT + TTS on single port, includes transcribed text)

After setup, use the menubar buttons for configuration instructions.

## Voice Input Modes

Three modes for speech-to-text, all using your local Whisper server. Transcribed text is typed directly into whatever app you have focused.

### Hold-to-Talk (default)

1. Hold **Ctrl** — recording starts immediately
2. Speak your message
3. Release **Ctrl** — audio is transcribed and inserted

### Press-to-Talk

1. Press **Ctrl** — recording starts (red indicator)
2. Speak your message
3. Press **Ctrl** again — audio is sent to Whisper for transcription
4. Text is inserted via Accessibility (native apps) or CGEvent Unicode typing (all others) — clipboard is never touched

### Hands-Free

No button press needed. Uses on-device keyword detection (Apple Speech framework).

1. say **"initiate"** — recording starts (cyan → red indicator)
2. speak your message
3. **3 seconds of silence** — audio is auto-transcribed and inserted
4. returns to listening for "initiate" again
5. say **"hold on"** during TTS playback — interrupts audio and starts recording

> **Tip:** "Hold on" barge-in works best with headphones — without them the mic may pick up the TTS audio instead of your voice.

### Requirements

- **Microphone permission** — macOS will prompt on first use
- **Accessibility permission** — required for typing text into other apps. Grant in System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility

> **Note:** After rebuilding from source, you must remove and re-add the app in Accessibility settings (macOS caches the code signature).

### Automation

Both features are in the **Automation** section of the menubar and require **Accessibility permission** (macOS will prompt you on first use).

#### Auto-Focus

Enable **Auto-Focus** to automatically bring a specific app to the front when you finish speaking. Pick from 15 apps (VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Xcode, Sublime Text, Nova, Fleet, Claude, Terminal, iTerm2, Warp, Alacritty, Ghostty) or select **CUSTOM** to type any app name. Uses native `NSRunningApplication.activate()` — no System Events permission needed.

#### Auto-Submit

Enable **Auto-Submit** to automatically submit after every transcription — no trigger word needed. The transcribed text is typed and Enter is pressed.

**Barge-in:** Any currently playing TTS audio is automatically interrupted when you start recording (press Ctrl) or when Auto-Submit triggers, so you can speak without waiting for the AI to finish talking.

### Fallback: macOS Dictation

If you prefer not to grant Accessibility permission, press **fn fn** to use built-in macOS dictation. Less accurate for technical terms, but works instantly with zero setup.

## How the VOICE Tag Works

Claude adds a `[VOICE: ...]` tag at the end of every response:

```
Here's the full code with detailed explanation...

[VOICE: I added the login endpoint. It validates the email and returns a JWT token.]
```

- **Screen**: You see the full detailed response
- **Speakers**: You hear only the short spoken summary
- The hook script extracts the tag, sends it to Kokoro TTS, and plays the audio
- If there's no `[VOICE:]` tag, the hook falls back to stripping markdown and reading the raw text (truncated to ~600 chars)

### Voice Detail Levels

Choose how verbose the spoken summary is (set in the menubar under **Detail**):

| Level | Sentences | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **Brief** | 1 | Just the key outcome |
| **Natural** | 1-3 | Conversational summary (default) |
| **Detailed** | 4-6 | Thorough explanation of what changed, why, and what to do next |

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Used by | Description |
|----------|---------|---------|-------------|
| `TTS_URL` | `http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech` | tts-hook.sh | Unified server TTS endpoint |
| `TTS_VOICE` | `af_heart` | tts-hook.sh | Kokoro voice name |
| `TTS_VOLUME` | `1` | tts-hook.sh | Playback volume (0.3=Low, 1=Medium, 4=High) |
| `TTS_MODEL` | `prince-canuma/Kokoro-82M` | tts-hook.sh | TTS model |
| `SERVER_PORT` | `8000` | unified_server.py | Server port |
| `WHISPER_MODEL` | `mlx-community/whisper-large-v3-turbo` | unified_server.py | Whisper model |

> **Tip:** Setting a specific language (e.g. English) instead of auto-detect prevents Whisper from hallucinating text in other languages during silence or background noise.

## Troubleshooting

**No audio after response:**
1. Check TTS server is running: `curl http://localhost:8000/models`
2. Test TTS directly: `echo "hello" | ./scripts/speak.sh`
3. Check the hook path in `settings.json` is correct and absolute

**Push-to-talk not typing text:**
1. Check Accessibility permission is granted in System Settings
2. If rebuilt from source, remove and re-add the app in Accessibility settings
3. Check Events Log in the menubar for diagnostic details

**422 error from TTS:**
- Make sure `model` field is included in requests
- Run `./setup.sh` again to reinstall spaCy model

## Manual Setup (from source)

> **Tip:** You can ask your AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) to run these steps for you. Just paste the section below into your AI chat.

### Prerequisites

- Mac with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) (CLI or VS Code extension)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) — install with one of:
  ```bash
  # Option A: Direct download (no package manager needed)
  curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/jq https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/download/jq-1.7.1/jq-macos-arm64 && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/jq

  # Option B: Homebrew (if you have it)
  brew install jq
  ```

### Step 1: Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PerIPan/OpenWhisperer.git
cd OpenWhisperer
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh
```

This creates a Python venv at `~/mlx-openai-whisper` and installs everything (MLX Audio, Whisper, Kokoro TTS, spaCy).

### Step 2: Start the servers

```bash
./servers/start-servers.sh
```

One unified server starts on:
- `localhost:8000` — Whisper STT + Kokoro TTS (both on one port)

Keep this terminal open while using Claude.

### Step 3: Tell Claude to speak

Copy the `CLAUDE.md` file into any project where you want voice mode:

```bash
cp CLAUDE.md ~/my-project/
```

This tells Claude to add a `[VOICE: ...]` tag to every response with a short spoken summary.

### Step 4: Add the TTS hook

Add this to your `~/.claude/settings.json` (or your project's `.claude/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "/absolute/path/to/OpenWhisperer/hooks/tts-hook.sh",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `/absolute/path/to/OpenWhisperer` with where you cloned the repo (e.g. `/Users/yourname/OpenWhisperer`).

### Building the App from Source

```bash
cd app
chmod +x build-dmg.sh
./build-dmg.sh
```

Requires Xcode Command Line Tools. Produces `Open Whisperer.app` and `OpenWhisperer-1.4.0.dmg` in `app/.build/`.
