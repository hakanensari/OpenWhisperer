#   voice  (default) — speak only voice-dictated turns (prompt hash matches voice_turn)
#   text             — speak only typed turns (no fresh voice_turn match)
#   always           — speak every turn
# On "speak", mark the session (speak_pending/<id>) so the Stop hook reads the reply,
# and inject a hidden nudge so the reply opens with a standalone spoken summary.
